## [Chongxuan Li](https://github.com/zhenxuan00), Max Welling, Jun Zhu and Bo Zhang

Code for reproducing most of the results in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03429). We also provide implementation of a lot of recent papers, which is of independent interests.

Warning: the code is still under development. If you have any problem with the code, please send an email to chongxuanli1991@gmail.com. Any feedback will be appreciated!

We thank the authors of [wgan-gp](https://github.com/igul222/improved_wgan_training) for providing their code. Our code is widely adapted from their repositories.

You may need to download the datasets and save it to the dataset folder except the MNIST case. See details in the corresponding files of the dataset.
